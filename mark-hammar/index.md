<div class="text-justify">
I am a highly optimistic, talented communications consultant who lives to assist companies with all of their marketing, design, and print needs. It is my goal to ensure that every project serves its intended purpose. I'm inspired by the uniqueness of individual challenges and have a genuine talent for finding just the right solution.  

Prior to establishing my consulting agency I had the privilege of working at Harvest Christian Fellowship. For 17 years I managed the design team, and worked hand in hand with the marketing, video, music and web teams.  

My goal is to be the consultant for all your needs. Having you choose me to assist your company means a lot to me. Communications is something that I love and enjoy, whether it is design, advertising, informational, or personal. Let me be the consultant you always call on.  
Contact me today!
